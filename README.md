# README

Both notebooks explore the complex problem of optimal execution, addressing crucial aspects of trading strategy that are central to modern financial mathematics. Specifically, they tackle classic issues such as **liquidity risk**, **volatility risk**, and **permanent and temporary market impact**.

## Notebook 1: Optimal Split of Orders Across Regular Market and Dark Pools

### Overview

This notebook focuses on finding the optimal way to split orders between the regular market and dark pools using a stochastic algorithm. It provides an implementation of the algorithm given in the article of S. Laruelle, C.-A. Lehalle, and G. Pages : *"Optimal Split of Orders Across Liquidity Pools: A Stochastic Algorithm Approach"*, published in the SIAM Journal of Financial Mathematics, Volume 2, pp. 1042-1076, 2011.


## Notebook 2: Optimal Execution Using Algrem Chriss Algorithm

### Overview

This notebook implements the Algrem Chriss algorithm for optimal execution of trades and explores the sensitivity of execution performance to various parameters. The primary parameters examined are risk aversion ($\lambda$), permanent market impact ($\eta$), and temporary market impact ($\gamma$).
